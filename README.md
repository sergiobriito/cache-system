# Java Cache System

This project is a cache system built from scratch in Java. It uses a socket-based connection between the client and server and implements an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache structure. The cache system allows the methods `put` and `get`.

## Features

- **LRU Cache**: Implements a cache with the LRU eviction policy.
- **Socket Communication**: Uses sockets for communication between the client and server.
- **Put Method**: Allows storing key-value pairs in the cache.
- **Get Method**: Retrieves a value from the cache based on a given key.
